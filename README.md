**Financial Performance Dashboard Project**

**Overview**
This project showcases a Financial Performance Dashboard developed in Power BI. It provides a clear and interactive overview of an organization's financial health, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. The project was part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp 4.0 at Codebasics, specifically from their "Get Job Ready: Power BI Data Analytics for All Levels 3.0" course.

**Objective**
The dashboard focuses on analyzing key financial metrics to offer insights into trends, performance, and areas requiring attention. The analysis highlights metrics like:
